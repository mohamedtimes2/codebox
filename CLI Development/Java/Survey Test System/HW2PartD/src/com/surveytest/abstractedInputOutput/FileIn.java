/**
 * Please note this class is here as an example and the error checking is minimal.
 *
 * SPECIAL NOTE: It's difficult to generalize parsing and reading a file, particularly
 * when the interface is generally expecting user interaction. This class should be
 * specialized for any real usage and is simply here as a *very* basic example. Also
 * note, as this is for demonstration, it assumes it is reading from "default.out" that
 * FileOut writes to, by default.
 *
 * ***************************************************************************************
 * SERIOUSLY: If I see this class used with any of the assignments in this course
 * without meaningful modification I will take off a boatload of points. THIS IS ONLY HERE
 * FOR DEMONSTRATION!!! DO NOT JUST COPY AND PASTE THIS CODE / FILE INTO YOUR INTELLIJ
 * PROJECT AND CALL IT GOOD ENOUGH.
